It will add test data to the database, which makes it easier to work with. For example, it will create products, transfer test images and create a test user for access to the admin panel:  \n> login - user@mail.com  \n> password - Pass123\n\n#### Admin panel (frontend)\nTo develop the web interface of the admin panel, you need to start the litepay server (for example, execute the command from the project root `go run ./cmd/main.go serve`).\nThe entire code is located in the folder ./web/admin.  \nAll the code is located in the folder ./web/admin. The command `cd ./web/admin && yarn run dev` will start the development server for the admin panel web interface. By default, it will be available at http://localhost:5173/_/.\n\n#### Base site (frontend)\nTo develop the web interface of the admin panel, you need to start the litepay server (for example, execute the command from the project root `go run ./cmd/main.go serve`).  \nRun `./scripts/webscripts` to download and install the necessary JavaScript libraries into the folder ./web/site/public/assets/js/.\nTo update the styles, it is necessary to execute the command `cd ./web/site && yarn run build`.  \nIf you actively change styles, you can run the command `cd ./web/site && yarn run dev`. It will monitor changes in files and automatically update the style file.\n\n## üó∫Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;ToDo\n"}
