The frontend (admin site and base site) operates on the Vue3 and TailwindCSS.  \n\nThere are a number of scripts (in the ./scripts folder) that simplify development:  \n`./scripts/golang` - Installs or updates a previously installed version of go (if needed).  \n`./scripts/migration` - Helps to work with migrations. For instance, the `./scripts/migration dev up` command will apply new migrations from folder ./migrations, then implement the migrations from folder ./fixtures.  \n`./scripts/sqlite` - Optimizes the existing database.  \n`./scripts/tools` - Sets up the necessary environment for development (if needed).  \n"}
